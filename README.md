# cryostat-knowledge-hub

A guided knowledge hub for contributing to Cryostat, written by OpenJDK interns at Red Hat.

## SEE ALSO

* [Cryostat](https://cryostat.io/): The official Cryostat website.
* [cryostatio](https://github.com/cryostatio/cryostat-operator): The GitHub organization that holds all projects of the components of Cryostat.
* [JDK Mission Control](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc) for the original JDK Mission Control, which is the desktop application complement to JFR.

## DOCUMENTATIONS
Most of the important documentation on how to develop and test Cryostat can already be found on the corresponding GitHub repository of each Cryostat component. These can be found [below](#external-links).

However, this knowledge hub is, _hopefully_, a good place to refer to as more of a guided learning centre. The hub's main object is to expand the already fantastic documentation, and provide more learning resources and helpful `bash` scripts for information and workflow that may not be so obvious to new interns, hires, or anyone wanting to contribute!
